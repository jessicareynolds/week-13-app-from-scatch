                    My name is Jessica, I’m a maker of things. I’ve been altering clothes since I was a young girl, often changing items to fit better or express my style. I started embroidering in 2016. Its been a therapeutic outlet to calm my mind and my hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stitch a collection of found and consciously made items. Depending on the design, I start with a hand drawing and then stitch over my line work. Because of this process each piece is unique. No two pieces will ever be the same.
